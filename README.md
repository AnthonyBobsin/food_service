Food Order Service README

This application consists of a service that allows users to sign up as a service or a customer.
As a service they will be able to post location of their service along with a menu of what is available to order.
As a user, after updating their method of payment they will be able to browse nearby services and order from their menus.
Once a user orders from a menu, the service recieves a message about the order.

Ruby Version: 4.2.0.rc1

Database: SQLite3 for development, PostgreSQL for production.

Heroku Address: https://shrouded-hollows-6531.herokuapp.com

Feel free to create an account to test out the creation of menus. Fake users were generated with 
the Faker gem for depth. When signing up remember to also sign up as a service so you can experiment with creating
your own menu from the account dropdown.

In progress: Adding some jQuery to allow users on edit menu to add more than one item at a time.
